Notes from DevSecOps ch.4 Vulnerability Management

As we make use of an array of tools for vulnerability scanning, it becomes important to have a way to easily process and visualize the findings
-> vulnerability management tools exist for this purpose eg. DefectDojo

DefectDojo requires:
- findings in files
- tool running in browser
- feed report files to the tool (interprets security report types produced from each scan tool)

DefectDojo allows you to:
- visualise scanning reports from many different tools
- can enhance findings data and train it to reduce false positives, dig and discover patterns
- bidirectional handling of findings ie. can pull from scan tool and push reports to Jira
- customisation and flexibility over process to fit different organisation needs. The hierarchy follows the pattern: Produce Type > Products > Enhancements (versions) > Tests > Findings

The setup would have following steps: 
1. Configure scan tools to generate report file as artifacts

3. Download the report files as artifacts from the pipeline

5. Run DefectDojo in browser (can make use of free to use demo tool provided by DefectDojo)

6. Import findings into DefectDojo
